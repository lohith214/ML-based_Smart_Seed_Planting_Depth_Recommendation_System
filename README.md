# ML-based_Smart_Seed_Planting_Depth_Recommendation_System
The ML-based Smart Seed Planting Depth Prediction System leverages real-time soil and weather data to recommend the optimal seed planting depth for various crops, including wheat, corn, and rice. By analyzing key parameters such as soil type, moisture content, temperature, and humidity, the system utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to deliver precise, crop-specific depth predictions.

This intelligent solution helps farmers achieve healthier plant growth and higher crop yields by enabling accurate, data-driven decisions. In addition, it promotes sustainable agriculture by minimizing resource wastage—such as water and energy—while supporting environmentally responsible farming practices.
